# API Integration Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Completed

### 1. **API Service Layer** (`src/services/api.ts`)
- Full REST API client for Jobs and Drivers
- Centralized error handling
- TypeScript typed API responses
- Health check endpoint
- Supports all CRUD operations:
  - `jobsAPI.getAll()`, `create()`, `update()`, `delete()`, `bulkCreate()`
  - `driversAPI.getAll()`, `create()`, `update()`, `delete()`

### 2. **Updated DispatchContext** (`src/context/DispatchContext.tsx`)
- **Now uses API by default** (can toggle with `useAPI` prop)
- All operations sync with backend:
  - ✅ Add/Update/Delete jobs → API calls
  - ✅ Add/Update/Delete drivers → API calls
- **Auto-fetches data** from backend on mount
- **localStorage as backup**: Still saves locally for offline fallback
- **Loading states**: `isLoading` tracks API operations
- **Error handling**: `error` state with user-friendly messages
- **Refresh function**: `refreshData()` to manually sync

### 3. **Connection Status Component** (`src/components/ConnectionStatus.tsx`)
- Real-time API health monitoring (checks every 30 seconds)
- Visual indicators:
  - 🟢 **Green**: Connected to backend
  - 🔴 **Red**: Offline (using localStorage)
  - 🟡 **Yellow**: Checking connection
- Error banner at top with retry button
- Loading indicator during API operations
- Status badge in bottom-right corner

### 4. **Environment Configuration**
- ✅ `VITE_API_URL` configured in `vercel.json`
- ✅ Points to: `https://dispatch-app-production.up.railway.app`
- ✅ TypeScript types added (`src/vite-env.d.ts`)

### 5. **Railway Configuration**
- ✅ `railway.toml` created to deploy backend from `/backend` folder
- Build command: `cd backend && npm install && npm run build`
- Start command: `cd backend && npm start`

## 📋 Current Status

### Frontend (Vercel)
- ✅ Build passing
- ✅ TypeScript errors fixed
- ✅ API integration code ready
- ⏳ **Needs push to deploy**

### Backend (Railway)
- ❌ Currently DOWN (502 error)
- ⏳ **Needs `railway.toml` pushed to fix deployment**
- ⏳ Needs environment variables set in Railway dashboard

### Connection
- ⏳ **Will auto-connect once backend is live**
- ✅ Fallback to localStorage if backend unavailable

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Step 1: Push Changes
```bash
git push
```

This will:
- Deploy updated frontend to Vercel with API code
- Trigger Railway to redeploy with correct backend configuration

### Step 2: Configure Railway Backend
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Check deployment logs for any errors
3. Ensure environment variables are set:
   - `PORT` (Railway sets automatically)
   - `FRONTEND_URL` = `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app`
   - `NODE_ENV` = `production`

### Step 3: Verify Connection
Once both are deployed:
1. Open your Vercel URL
2. Look for connection status in bottom-right corner:
   - Should show "Connected" (green)
3. Check browser console for any API errors
4. Try creating a job - it should sync to backend

---

## 🔍 Testing the Connection

Once deployed, test these scenarios:

### Test 1: Data Persistence
1. Create a job in the app
2. Refresh the page
3. Job should still be there (loaded from API)

### Test 2: Cross-Device Sync
1. Open app on Device A, create a job
2. Open app on Device B
3. Job should appear there too

### Test 3: Offline Mode
1. Stop Railway backend (or disconnect internet)
2. App should show "Offline Mode" status
3. Should still work with localStorage
4. When backend comes back online, data syncs

## 🔧 How to Toggle Between API and localStorage

If you need to temporarily disable API and use only localStorage:

```tsx
// In src/main.tsx or App.tsx
<DispatchProvider useAPI={false}>
  {/* your app */}
</DispatchProvider>
```

Default is `useAPI={true}`, so backend is used automatically.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Implemented
- Full CRUD operations synced with backend
- Real-time connection monitoring
- Graceful offline fallback
- Error handling with user feedback
- Loading states for all operations
- TypeScript type safety
- Environment-based configuration

### 🚧 Backend Needs Implementation
The backend API routes (`/backend/src/routes/*`) may need:
- Database integration (currently in-memory)
- Data persistence layer
- Authentication/Authorization
- Input validation

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### If frontend shows "Offline Mode":
1. Check Railway backend logs
2. Verify `VITE_API_URL` in Vercel environment variables
3. Test backend directly: `curl https://dispatch-app-production.up.railway.app/health`

### If data doesn't sync:
1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
2. Look for failed API requests
3. Check CORS settings in backend
4. Verify `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway environment variables

## 🎉 Summary

**Your app is now a full-stack application!**

- ✅ Frontend: React + TypeScript
- ✅ Backend: Express + TypeScript
- ✅ Connection: REST API
- ✅ Deployment: Vercel + Railway
- ✅ Fallback: localStorage for offline mode

**Just push the changes and both will be live!**
