## Troubleshooting

### Railway Shows 404 Error
**Solution**: Make sure you set Root Directory to `backend` in Railway Settings

### Build Fails on Railway
**Solution**: Check Railway logs:
1. Click on your service
2. Click "View Logs"
3. Look for error messages

### Frontend Can't Connect to Backend
**Solution**:
1. Check `VITE_API_URL` in Vercel settings matches your Railway URL
2. Check `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway settings matches your Vercel URL
3. Both should use `https://`

### CORS Errors
**Solution**: Make sure both URLs are correct and use HTTPS
